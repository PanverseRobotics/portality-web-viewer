# Portality Splat Viewer

This is a WebGL2 implementation of a browser-based renderer for Gaussian Splats, see [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). Unlike some previous renderers, this renderer uses a gpu-based bitonic sort algorithm that makes it much faster and eliminates jerky animations. Also, it is fully WebGL 2 compatible, making it available across a wide variety of browsers, including mobile browsers.

This can be hosted locally using a webserver pointing to this folder or it can be accessed at [https://viewer.portality.ai](https://viewer.portality.ai)

## Controls 

The controls are based on the position of the camera and focus point (where the camera is looking at).

Left mouse + drag: Orbit camera around the focus point.
Right mouse + drag: Pan camera by moving focus point around camera's origin.
Mouse wheel: Dolly camera closer/farther from the focus point.

## Setting default camera params

The camera parameters on startup, such as camera position, the location where the camera is looking, and the up vector, can be specified as parameters, e.g.

```
https://viewer.portality.ai/index.html?camera=5.0,0.0,0.0&lookAt=0.1,0.0,0.08&up=0.0,-1.0,0.0
```

## Examples

The splat format is compatible with the .splat format introduced by https://github.com/antimatter15/splat.
