# Portality Splat Viewer

This is a WebGL2 implementation of a browser-based renderer for Gaussian Splats, see [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). Unlike some previous renderers, this renderer uses a gpu-based bitonic sort algorithm that makes it much faster and eliminates jerky animations. Also, it is fully WebGL 2 compatible, making it available across a wide variety of browsers, including mobile browsers.

## Controls 

The controls are based on the position of the camera and focus point (where the camera is looking at).

Left mouse + drag: Orbit camera around the focus point.
Right mouse + drag: Pan camera by moving focus point around camera's origin.
Mouse wheel: Dolly camera closer/farther from the focus point.

## Examples

The splat format is compatible with the .splat format introduced by https://github.com/antimatter15/splat.
